# ISEC-25-Workshop
Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Workshop on Advancing Software Engineering with Generative AI and LLM-Based Agents. This workshop focuses on exploring the convergence of traditional software engineering methodologies and cutting-edge Generative AI (GenAI) technologies to enhance software development processes, especially within large-scale and complex software systems.

Objective of the Workshop
Software engineering at scale is an effort-intensive and time-consuming process. However, modern IT systems require rapid changes, often derived from legacy software or incomplete requirements. This makes software development a complex mix of forward engineering, reverse engineering, and transformation involving code, data, and specifications, both structured and unstructured.

The increasing complexity of software development has highlighted the need for domain knowledge, often provided by subject matter experts (SMEs), throughout the software development lifecycle (SDLC). While Model-Driven Engineering (MDE), Knowledge Engineering (KE), and Reverse Engineering (RE) have mitigated some of these challenges, recent advancements in Generative AI (GenAI) hold the potential for substantial improvements in productivity.

However, several hurdles remain, including the need for high-quality datasets that cover a diverse set of programming tasks, languages, and coding styles, as well as the challenge of dealing with dynamic business requirements and evolving technologies. Large Language Models (LLMs) and their associated agents are rapidly growing, but they need to continuously adapt to keep pace with the evolving software development landscape.

Key Focus Areas of the Workshop
Over the past year, the use of Generative AI in software development has matured, with tools like GitHub Copilot, Amazon CodeWhisperer, AutoCodeRover + GPT-4, Assistant GRU, and SWE Agent + Claude 3.5 Sonnet transforming various aspects of software engineering, including:

Code development and completion
Test case generation
Debugging and issue resolution
The integration of reinforcement learning and instruction tuning into these tools has further enhanced their capabilities, but there is still much to explore.

Central Questions to Explore:
Augmentation of Software Engineering Tasks with LLMs
Architecting, designing, developing, and maintaining industry-strength software is a multi-skilled, long-term activity. Can LLMs alone address all of these needs, or is augmentation necessary?

Focus on Local Knowledge for SDLC
While LLMs are vast repositories of general knowledge, software development requires focused, domain-specific knowledge. How can LLMs effectively apply this knowledge at scale in real-world SDLC scenarios?

Mining Purpose-Driven Knowledge from Software Artifacts
How can Generative AI be effectively used to mine and construct useful knowledge from existing software artifacts? Can it modernize legacy systems to improve correctness, reduce costs, and shorten timelines?

Enhancement of Testing and Test Data Synthesis
Can Generative AI improve the synthesis of tests and test data during the SDLC, and what tools or methodologies are best for this task?

Bug Fixes and Change Request Management
How can Generative AI expedite the analysis and implementation of bug fixes and change requests, improving turnaround times and reducing human error?

Ensuring Accuracy and Reliability of AI-Generated Artifacts
What are the best practices for ensuring that software artifacts generated by Generative AI are accurate, relevant, and reliable?

State-of-the-Art Techniques and Methodologies
What are the cutting-edge experimental models, methodologies, benchmark datasets, and evaluation metrics for using LLMs and LLM-based agents in software engineering? How do task performances differ between LLMs and LLM-based agents?

Goals
The primary goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers and practitioners to collaborate on how we can leverage the strengths of Generative AI, LLM Agentic Frameworks, Model-Driven Engineering (MDE), Knowledge Engineering (KE), and Reverse Engineering (RE) to improve software engineering practices.

Through this collaborative platform, we aim to:

Define a trajectory for enhancing software engineering practices by combining GenAI, LLM agents, and traditional methodologies.
Discuss real-world challenges in the application of Generative AI for software engineering tasks.
Share insights on the evolving role of LLM-based agents in the SDLC.
