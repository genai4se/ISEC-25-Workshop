            <p><b>Title: Playing with Abstractions: At the crossroads of Software Architecture and Generative AI<p></b>
            <p><b>Abstract</b> Text is a powerful abstraction of reality, like architecture abstracts complex software systems. 
	  The advent of Generative AI specifically Large Language Models (LLMs) has set new benchmarks in understanding and generating human-like text, revolutionizing multiple sectors. 
	  In this talk, we explore some of these capabilities of LLMs to understand whether LLMs can be architect's new best friend. We begin with an overview of Large Language Models (LLMs) and exploring their role in generating design decisions through our research on leveraging GenAI for architecture knowledge management. 
	  We then explore their impact on automating component generation based on our ongoing research in the serverless context. Further, we provide insights on LLMs’ capabilities for supporting runtime architectural adaptation, highlighting our efforts on building Generative AI-powered autonomous CloudOps Copilot in collaboration with our industrial partner.  
	  The talk concludes by listing different opportunities and challenges drawing insights from our ongoing efforts involving Small Language Models as well as in architecting multi-agent framework for cloudOps domain. </p>

            <p><b>Title: Navigating the Landscape of AI Agents: Characteristics, Innovations, and Future Directions<p></b>
            <p id="Dinesh"><b id="Hridesh">Abstract</b> The field of AI agents has gained substantial attention in recent years due to the surge in AI capabilities and the demand for automation in complex tasks. 
		    AI agents, with their ability to reason, plan, act, and interact, represent a significant advancement over traditional automation techniques. In this talk, we will explore the evolving trends and defining features of AI agents, providing a foundation for understanding their transformative potential. We will delve into cutting-edge paradigms such as ReACt, Reflection, and Reflexion agents, showcasing their unique approaches to problem-solving. Building on this, we will highlight recent advances in agentic software engineering research with demonstrations of our work on agentic NL2SQL and automated testing agents. 
		    Finally, we will discuss critical challenges regarding the reliability and robustness of AI agents, laying the groundwork for future research in this exciting field. </p>
